# Simple Todo List App

This is a simple (not that rubust...) but functional todo list app. You can access the deployed version at https://wztodo.herokuapp.com/

The frontend is designed using React, and the backend is implemented with Node.js and MongoDB.

You can deploy it to a container with the provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile), then access it via port 8000.

Run `./dev.sh` to make further development. Note: make sure you have `nodemon` installed as the script requires it. It's a great tool for developing node.js server!
