                Hi! I'm Will, a forth-year student major in computer science!
                I have a strong backend development background, but only know
                some basic concepts in frontend, so I hope this course could
                help me practice my frontend skills :)
            </p>
            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p>
                We are building an app that can plan your day!
                Just tell it what are you feeling, it will recommand
                outdoor activities you might interested in, and make
                you a detailed plan for your to visit all of them :)
